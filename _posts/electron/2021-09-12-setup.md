Before we begin, we need to understand what we need to know and what tools will be beneficial during the journey. We'll get familiar with basics soon enough.

### What is Electron?
Electron, also known as ElectronJS, is a framework for developing desktop applications with JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. Electron allows you to retain one JavaScript codebase and achieve cross-platform applications that function on Windows, macOS, and Linux by embedding Chromium and Node.js into its binary â€“ no native development knowledge necessary.

### Why use it and is it right for me?
Electron is a great choice for those who are already familiar with web technology like JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. As Electron's website says, "If you can build a website, you can build a desktop app.".
Howerver, if you're not at all familiar with web technology, you can either learn them, or Electron may not be for you.

## Requirements
While developing an Electron app all you really need is to have [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/) installed and a code editor.

I recommend using one of the followings as your code editor, or just your preferred one:
 - [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) (Free)
 - [WebStorm](https://www.jetbrains.com/webstorm/) (Trial) ([Free with discounts](https://www.jetbrains.com/webstorm/buy/#discounts))
 - [Atom](https://atom.io/) (Free)
 - [Sublime](https://www.sublimetext.com/) (Trial)

# Creating your Electron app
## Package File
Like with any other NodeJS project, we'll use the initate command to create our package file. The command will prompot you with some fields to set in your configuration. First, create a folder where you want your project to be, then open your terminal in that folder with the `cd` command. We could also create a folder with `mkdir` command as well:
```bash
mkdir electron-app && cd electron-app
npm init
``` 

Once you're done with the `init` command, a new file named <u>package.json</u> should of generated, it'll look something like this:
```json
{
  "name": "electron-app",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "description": "Hello, internet!",
  "main": "main.js",
  "author": "JohnSmith",
  "license": "MIT"
}
```

Now we have to install the `electron` package under your app's `devDependecies`. We can do this by simply running:
```
npm install --save-dev electron@latest
```

Finally, we're going to want a way to start the Electron app in developer mode. In your <u>package.json</u>, add the following:
```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "start": "electron ."
  }
}
```

The package file is prepared, but don't use the start script yet since it will return an error because there is no app file or information for it to show or pull from. Let's start creating the main process now for it to work with.

## Main Process
Most commonly in Electron apps, the main process is named as either <u>main.js</u> or <u>index.js</u>. In this case I'm going with <u>main.js</u>. In the main process to run two modules of Electron that are nessessary, both `app` and `BrowserWindow`. The `app` module controls your application's event lifecycle while the `BrowserWindow` creates and manages application windows.

Since the main process runs through NodeJS, you'll need to add this line at the very top of <u>main.js</u>:
```js
const {app, BrowserWindow} = require('electron')
```

Then we'll a new function called `createWindow()` that loads the HTML content into the `BrowserWindow`:
```js
function createWindow() {
    const mainWindow = new BrowserWindow({
        width: 800,
        height: 600
    })
    mainWindow.loadFile('index.html')
}
```

We'll now need to find a way for the app to call this function so it can open the main window. Usually, in Electron, `BrowserWindow`s are only allowed to be created after the `app` module is ready. We can use the `app.whenReady()` API for this:
```js
app.whenReady().then(() => {
    createWindow()
})
```

## Content
In the main process, we set our main window open a file called `index.html`, using the `loadFile` API. Let's go ahead and create that file now, named as <u>index.html</u> of course. Usually what content is added is up to you, it's your app after all, but for now let's use an example so we can confirm that things work.

In the meantime, let's use this example:
```html
<html>
    <head>
        <title>Hello, internet!</title>
        <meta charset=UTF-8>
    </head>
    <body>
        <h1>Hello, internet!</h1>
        <p>I built an app :D</p>
    </body>
</html>
```

## Running the app
We can now try to run the app, as we have all the basics requirements in now. We can run the app by simply running:
```
npm start
```
